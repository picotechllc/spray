# Terminal Command Formatting

Never add any formatting characters to terminal commands. Always keep them entirely in plaintext.

## Examples

✅ Correct:
```sh
go test -v ./...
```

❌ Incorrect:
```sh
[200~go test -v ./...
```

## Why This Matters

1. Bracketed paste mode sequences (`[200~`) are terminal control characters that can:
   - Break command execution
   - Cause commands to fail, sometimes silently and/or expensively
   - Make commands difficult to copy/paste
   
2. This is especially important for:
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Documentation
   - Automated testing
   - Shell scripts

## Additional Guidelines

- Avoid line continuations (`\`) when possible
- Use `| cat` for commands that might invoke a pager (e.g., `git log | cat`)
- For long commands, consider using a script file instead
